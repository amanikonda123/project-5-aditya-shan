To trigger the world even, the user must click in area where there are no current entities(trees, dudes, etc.). When the
world event is triggered, a meteor should spawn that creates a crater as well as spawns a goo monster entity whose job
is to target nearest Dude entity and infect them. Triggering this even will also spawn a hospital with a doctor in it,
the doctor entities job is to seek out Dude entities who have been infected by the goop monster. The infected Dude
entities(aka Poisoned Dudes) will target fairies and try to kill them. The goo monster will disappear once it has
infected a Dude entity, however, if there are no more infected dudes or goop monster the meteor will unleash another
monster to target the dudes. The more meteors spawned also leads to more doctors being spawned in the hospital to keep
game balanced. Aditya was responsible for developing the functionality of the goo monster entity and poisoned dude
entity, as well as designing the sprites for them. Shantanu was responsible for developing the functionality of the
meteor entity and the doctor entity.
