To trigger the world event, the user must click in area where there are no current entities (trees, dudes, etc.). When the
world event is triggered, a meteor should spawn that creates a crater that releases purple goo onto the surrounding background.
The crater will also spawn a Goo Monster entity whose job is to target nearest Dude entity and infect them. Triggering this
event will also spawn a Hospital with a Doctor by it. The Doctor entities' job is to seek out Dude entities who have been poisoned
by the goo monster. The Poisoned Dude entities will target Fairies and will try to kill them. If there are no more Fairies remaining
in the world, then the Poisoned Dudes will go to the Hospital to try to get cured. The Goo Monster will then disappear
once it has infected a Dude entity, however, if there are no Poisoned Dudes in the world, the Meteor crater will unleash another
Goo Monster to target the Dudes. With every Meteor that spawns, a new Doctor will spawn from the Hospital to try to keep up
with the amount of Poisoned Dudes that would be in the game.

entity, as well as designing all the sprites. Shantanu was responsible for developing the functionality of the
Meteor entity, the Doctor entity, and the Hospital entity.
